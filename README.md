# Handcrafted Achievement

From concept to execution, every aspect of the game - from ideas to visuals - is meticulously handcrafted, infused with countless hours of imagination, programming, and the use of various tools. By drawing inspiration from renowned titles such as Inscryption and Resident Evil, we aimed to enhance depth and familiarity in the gaming experience.

Our objective was to replicate the immersive quality of AAA video games, transcending the limitations typically associated with browser-based platforms. The goal was to create an environment where players would be fully absorbed in the game, forgetting they were playing within a browser - This ambitious endeavor represents our commitment to push ourselves always more!
