# Overview

Let Me Out is a multiplayer online escape room experience filled with exploration, puzzles, and mini-games. Effective communication and teamwork are crucial for success as players race against the clock to get out!

Whether you're a casual player seeking a more relaxed journey or a gamer craving a challenge, the difficulty selection will ensure an experience that suits your team style.

Player progress is tracked through statistics, with each receiving an individual score and rank based on their performance. Additionally, the team will receive a collective score, determining their placement in the overall ranking.

## Dev Note

From concept to execution, every aspect of the game - from ideas to visuals - are originally made, infused with many hours of imagination, programming, the use of various tools and the inspiration from renowned titles such as Inscryption and Resident Evil.

The objective was to replicate the immersive quality of AAA video games, transcending the limitations typically associated with browser-based platforms; and create an environment where players would be fully absorbed in the game, forgetting they are playing within a browser.

This ambitious endeavor represents a commitment to always push for more!
